The instructions say to reverse engineer the example given but without looking at or copying the examples code. Even though I was tempted, I did not give in to cheating on this one which resulted to me spending about four days on this project (longer than I had expected) and about 10 hours.<br /><br />The most challenging things for me was working with CSS and html. I completed all of the FCC courses before hand, but the information for these two didn't seem to stick well in my brain. I began searching the internet for help and Youtube became my best friend for this project, in particular <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvAAZChoagM3Ch63apDSE6Ra6NeI62sQV">Wired Wiki</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUoqTnNH-2Xz_BUrjcahKWDhPcUj-FTOt">Brian Husseyâ€™s</a> tutorials.<br /><br />There was a lot of note taking and re-watching clips to get down the nesting concepts in this project, but I eventually got the hang of it and the fact that I struggled at first gave let me know that I needed to take it slow in order to comprehend everything, which I eventually did.<br /><br /><a href="http://codepen.io/johnromani90/full/ZbWXdG/">My end result can be found here</a>, which I am happy with because it met all the credentials of the project, but I could have made more of an effort to learn how to customize some of the buttons and background images. Over all this project really helped me with learning html, CSS, and Bootstrap basics!<br /><br />-John
