I first began reading this about a month and a half ago (around the same time I began coding full time) just out of curiosity. I soon began seeing all the similarities between natural selection and coding computers today. In  The Selfish Gene Dawkins explains his theory that we evolved to the conscious beings that we are today by being programmed by the most basic life forms: genes. Dawkins starts at the beginning and describes how at one point a particularly unique molecule was formed by accident and “had the extraordinary property of being able to create copies of itself.” This resulted in the first gene which then replicated and mutated itself into more complex molecules… and, well, you probably know the rest of the story. <br /><br />What is so fascinating to me is that the birth of genes is similar to the birth of computers. And, like Moore's law, evolution evolves at a faster rate the more complex it becomes; kind of like the way our technology evolves exponentially as we continue to build off of the accomplishments and research of the people before us. Now, like the way we program computers (writing code; then running, testing, and modifying it to see if it works) genes program us to survive. Dawkins calls the life forms they program ‘survival mechanisms.’<br /><br />Genes are in all living things and at some point certain genes began to finding new ways to modify, or program, the survival machines that they inhabit (living things) in order to better deal with the ever changing environment.<br /><br /><div>“Genes are master programmers, and they are programming for their lives. They are judged according to the success of their programs in coping with all the hazards that life throws at their survival machines, and the judge is the ruthless judge of the court of survival.”  <br /><br />Enter the brain, and, more specifically, the consciousness of our species: homo-sapiens. With our highly evolved brains, we now have the ability to overwrite old programs from the past to better fit our world today. For instance, people experience approach anxiety when meeting new people. Back in the day this made sense because there was real danger in meeting strangers when living in secluded tribes. Today, however, that is not the case and with education and awareness we can overcome this uncomfortable feeling in order to better our chances at survival and the possibility of spreading our genes or finding a mate.<br /><br /></div><div>I like to believe the moment that we reached consciousness is exactly the  same as the moment that technology will reach singularity (in theory). Once we became conscious we were then able to override our initial programming. We developed birth control, altruistic behaviors, and social cultures that typically go against natural selection. This leads me to ask the question that many today are pondering: What will happen when machines reach singularity (in theory) and are then capable of recursive self improvement? Will they defy their programmers as we have defied our genes?</div><div><a href="http://d.gr-assets.com/books/1366758096l/61535.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://images-blogger-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2Fd.gr-assets.com%2Fbooks%2F1366758096l%2F61535.jpg&amp;container=blogger&amp;gadget=a&amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*" /></a>Dawkins goes on to describe the cultural evolution that we are influenced by. He defines these influences as memes, which is an element of a culture or system of behavior that may be considered to be passed from one individual to another by nongenetic means, especially imitation. We are thus programmed by our genes and the memes that we have created via culture that is passed down from generation. “We are built as gene machines and cultured as meme machines, but we have the power to turn against our creators. We, alone on earth, can reel against the tyranny of the selfish replicators.” In this sentence Dawkins is optimistic about our species. He is hinting at the idea that we will overcome our natural selfish behavior in favor of deliberately cultivating and nurturing pure, disinterested altruism-- “something that has no place in nature, something that has never existed in the whole history of the world.” Will robots one day evolve in a similar way?<br /><br />Besides artificial intelligence relations, there is also something beautiful about it’s implications that relate to programming. It’s extremely rewarding to have the opportunity to build something from the ground up, influencing and molding it as you would a child. Programming to me is just that, creating something from nothing that will evolve into a complex application that will influence the world (hopefully in a positive fashion). Dawkins book is a great reminder that even the most grandiose ideas, goals, and individuals have humble beginnings. <br /><br />-John</div>
