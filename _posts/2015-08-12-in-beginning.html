Why should anyone learn to code? For me it comes down to investing in an education that makes sense in today’s ever evolving technical world. When I was searching for a degree to major in during my first couple of semesters in college I generally took the attitude that I should study the things that I enjoyed the most, and, in theory, a profitable job would follow suite. I choose to study English literature and if I could go back and do it again I would not necessarily change that. For me, the education I received from studying figures like Henry David Thoreau, Alan Watts, and James Weldon Johnson was monumental in my development as a person. The thirst for more of the things that we studied in class became desire that I could not quench, and to this day I spend much of my free time in the public libraries throughout Jacksonville.<br /><br />I would, however, lower my expectations of the exchange value a liberal arts degree merits from others, primarily future employers. Perception is reality, and education is only as valuable as that reality.<br /><br />My goal since my sophomore year of college was to go straight to law school after graduation. That began to change once I started to research law schools and began debunking many of the myths that surround the coveted JD. After speaking with attorneys, professors, and current law school students, I realized three things: One, practicing law is nothing like what you see on T.V.; Two, the financial investment of a law degree can be crippling-- forcing graduates to work in environments that they hate simply to pay back what they owe in student loans; And three, I realized that many of the graduates passing the bar exam are another two or three years away from actually knowing the ins and outs of the law game.<br /><br />After taking a "pause" after college, I began to search for a career I could fit into, and like many other college graduates, I had no idea what I was doing.<br /><br />A few months ago a friend of mine introduced me to the website codeacademy.com and told me to give coding a try. I began on the “Ruby” course. My curiosity rose. The next day I researched the mass influence that computer languages have on our world and its potential impact on the future and my curiosity turned to intrigue. People say there is a moment in our lives that wakes us up; an awakening of sorts. A moment so significant it's like seeing the world for the first time. This was not that moment for me. In fact, I envy those who experience sudden "aha!" moments that change their life around in an instant. For me that has never been the case, however, the introduction to Ruby was my very first step in taking control of my future and making a decision to enter the tech world. <br /><br />"A real decision is measured by the fact that you've taken a new action. If there's no action, you haven't truly decided." -Tony Robbins<br /><br />I have officially taken action. In early August I gave my two week notice to my employer and agreed that the 21st would be my last day. Since the middle of July I have been researching the proper path for a self taught programmer and I have been overwhelmed with the amount of information out there along with the amount of people in the community that are willing to help. Simply put, I can't wait for the 21st to come around so I can begin this journey full time. Until then, I will settle for nights and early mornings.<br /><br /> Today, as I write this, I am taking action for a better future. Creating this blog, investing in my self education, and learning a computer language are all steps that will help me reach my goal of securing a job in the tech industry.<br /><br />-John
