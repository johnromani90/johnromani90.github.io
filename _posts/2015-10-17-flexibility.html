As I continue this journey I am reminded many times over that flexibility is necessary when aiming to achieve any goal. What I mean by that? It is important not to become discouraged if one process is not getting you closer to your goal. In fact, that is bound to happen. What is important is the awareness that a process is not working and then the flexibility to modify it so that it gets you back on track. I have written in a previous blog post that I have a hard time of staying on track with one thing and thus not accomplishing anything. <br /><br />“Stay committed to your decisions, but stay flexible in your approach.” -Tony Robbins<div><br />In order to simplify my study strategies I am classifying my day into three parts: rise, learn, and plan. The rise part I have down, it consists of waking up, deep breathing, meditating, running 2 miles, and eating breakfast. This typically takes place between 6 and 7:30 a.m.<br /><br />The learning part of my day is where I typically go astray. Should I code on&nbsp;</div><div><br />codecademy? Free Code Camp? Read a book on JavaScript? Watch youtube videos on how to code? Or search for a new resource that I have not even discovered yet??? To help with this I am breaking this part of my day (which is anywhere from 8- 12 hours) into two parts:<br /><br />-Morning: I will read theory or a book on coding but ONLY ONE BOOK AT A TIME! The goal is to finish and write a blog post at the end of each week detailing what I learned from reading said book.<br /><br />-Afternoon: I will actively write code. This can be anything from codeacademy, freecodecamp, codeschool, or a project that I am currently working on. However, this will be decided THE NIGHT BEFORE. Which brings me to the third part of the day.<br /><br />Planning will take up the late afternoon and evening of my day. This is where I will decide what I will be working on the following day and also research any new material, ideas, job opportunities, and anything code related that interests me. This time will bleed into what I will also call “free time” which will consists of reading fiction or watching a football game in order to relax before bed.<br /><br />-John</div>
