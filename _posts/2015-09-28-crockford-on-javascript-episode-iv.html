I learned and met new friends in Orlando, and last week my older brother offered to take me on a week long canoe camping trip down the Santa Fe and Suwannee Rivers. All though I was a little hesitant to step away from the code for a whole week, I thought how many times do things like this come around? Needless to say, we had a blast and it was a much needed break from all the “screen time” I have been putting in lately. Now I feel refreshed, picking up where I left off with Free Code Camp’s Zipline Challenges. I will make a separate post about Zipline #1 this week, but for now I would like to talk about Douglas Crockford’s lectures on JavaScript. When the lectures were published, Crockford was the senior JS architect at Yahoo, however, today he holds that same position with PayPal.<br /><br />What I like most about these lectures is that they go into depth in theory AND history--which I find helpful since I don't have a strong computer background. In this lecture, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9qT9joc0M&amp;index=4&amp;list=PLK2r_jmNshM9o-62zTR2toxyRlzrBsSL2">Crockford on JavaScript- Episode IV:The Metamorphosis of Ajax</a>, Crockford discusses Ajax, CSS, HTML, and how all these things affect JavaScript today.<br /><br />My notes to this lecture can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AiFV6SBmisuhxCD3vM24rl74FRhKf8gXsWK5eKmsCM8/edit?usp=sharing">here</a> (beware, I do not use spell check on this document)<br /><br /><div>Being a newbie with code I find it difficult sometimes to give back to any part of the community; It's like I’m constantly asking questions of senior coders and never having anything to offer in return. I figure adding some of my notes to this blog can be a way for me to give back in case anyone is in my shoes in the future and needs some reference points to start from. I have already been through a number of Crockford’s lectures but did not take great notes, so, from this point forward I will be sure to take notes as if it is for the larger community :)<br /><br />-John</div>
